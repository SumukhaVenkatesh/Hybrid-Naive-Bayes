# Hybrid-Naive-Bayes
The purpose is to implement a Hybrid NB Classifier on the "A3_Q1_train.csv" dataset that uses Bernoulli NB (with default parameters) for categorical descriptive features and Gaussian NB (with default parameters) for the numerical descriptive features. The Hybrid NB model is used on the train data and its accuracy is computed again train data.
